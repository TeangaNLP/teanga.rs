Teanga Rust-Python Bindings
===========================

This library provides Python bindings for the Teanga Rust library, allowing you to use Rust code in Python applications.

This enables the `teanga` library to use the database features and the Cuac file format.

This package is intended to be used by installing Teanga with the `pyo3` feature as follows:

```bash
pip install teanga[pyo3]
```

## Features

- **Database Support**: Use Teanga's database features directly in Python.
- **Cuac File Format**: Read and write Cuac files using Teanga's Rust implementation.
- **Performance**: Leverage Rust's performance and safety in Python applications.
